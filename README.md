 In this pet shop management system , I tried to solve the problem of the petshop owners to manage their data digitally on web rather that noting it on any paper.

 This web app reduces the manual power because whenever entry is made in it it will be secure and less prone to security threats.


 We are not using any physical papeers to store the data so paper cost is also reduced .

 Shop owner can track the details of the petshop and can adopt the practice to achieve more profit in his/her business.

 We can also integrate machine learning in it to make this app more intelligent so that we can use chatbots to interact with customers and petshop owner too.

 NOTE:- I developed this app only for petshop owner and somebody has to make entry it , so that data will be saved in it. And this web app can be used in Pet Shops.

 I will make more improvements in it if possible , but I am also working on new technologies so we will see what awaits for us in the future.

 I hope everything good happens for everyone.
